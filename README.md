# 2022-Hurricane-Ian-Survey-Study
Developed by Shih-Kai Huang (Jacksonville State University, USA), Michael Lindell (University of Washington, USA), and Xilei Zhao (University of Florida, USA).

The goal of this study is to understand people’s evacuation decision-making process during a late-warning hurricane evacuation event---2022 Hurricane Ian. We collect the residents’ evacuation decisions, evacuation decision-making considerations and property protection actions from two formats of survey questionnaires (A&B). In each format, we have three parts, and both formats share the same first part focusing on evacuation decision-making. In the second part, Questionnaire A focuses on evacuation behavior while Questionnaire B focuses on property protection actions. Both questionnaires collect respondents’ demographic information in the third part. The two survey questionnaires were released in the same time (i.e., two panels) independently. The findings from the survey will help emergency managers and policymakers develop appropriate evacuation strategies to help communities better prepared for future events, particularly under a late-warning scenario.
